md"""# Data Collection as Abstraction

The word abstraction comes to us via the Latin verm _abstrahere_ meaining "to pull", "drag" or "draw away from" (_Information Ages_, p. 4)

>Abstraction: The action of considering something in the abstract, independently of its associations or attributes; the process of isolating properties or characteristics common to a number of diverse objects, events, etc., without reference to the peculiar properties of particular examples or instances. Also: the state of being considered in this way; abstractness. ([OED](oed.com/view/Entry/766?redirectedFrom=abstraction#eid))


-----------

>Generalization: The action or process of forming or expressing a general concept or proposition on the basis of inference from particular instances. ([OED](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/77505?redirectedFrom=generalization#eid))


------------

>In most dictionaries, the term abstraction is defined as a quality, generality, and ideas. Dictionary source [7] defines abstraction as “the act of considering something as a general quality or characteristics, apart from concrete realities, specific objects or actual instances”. Abstraction is the process of initial concept formulation and generalization of ideas by extracting common qualities from specific examples. Other definitions of abstraction related to generality are “a general idea or quality rather than an actual person, object, or event: an abstract idea or quality” by [8], and “the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events” by [9]. __These definitions all summarize abstraction as the act of generalizing something by taking out only important points from the detailed characteristics of a problem.__ (doi:10.1016/j.procir.2016.01.038)


The challenge is that what constitutes __"only important points"__ is context dependent.

md"""# Picasso's Bulls

On November 2, 1945 the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso started working in the lithography workshop of the Parisian Fernand Mourlot. For four months he feverishly worked on creating lithographics, an artistic form he had not worked with extensively in the past. The most famous product of these months is a series of lithographs of a bull. In the first four lithographs, the bull is getting more detailed, more "realistic." But starting with the 5th lithograph, each subsequent lithograph is more sparse, more "abstract" until in the last lithograph, Picasso only uses six (as I count them) lines to depict the bull. According to the art historian Irvine Lavine, Picasso's intent was to 

>to reduce the bull to its constituent parts, to recover the disjecta membra of his dream-bull—bred of pure lines to an elemental, disembodied, quintessential bullishness.

Our abstractions to date have essentially described a "bull" as existing alone in some universe. We have excluded everything about the environment which the bull lives in as well as the bull's society.
	
This is not a problem, as long as we recognize what we might call the __granularity__ of our model and the context for which that granuality was chosen.
"""
	
modelcomment= md"""
		
>However, to build a model we need to choose a level of granularity and try to stay within it, or the whole model would evaporate into the nothingness of truth. Any level of granularity is called a _stereotype_; e.g., we stereotype objects on earth by saying they each have a weight. A stereotype is a lie, more politely a conceptual simplification, that is convenient for the way we want to do business. (Spivak, David I. _Category Theory for the Sciences_ (p. 45). MIT Press.)

## More Utilitarian Abstraction
### Maps as Data Abstraction


Common examples of data abstractions are maps. What makes a map more useful than, say, a satellite image of the same region?

### __Example:__ Washington D.C. Metro Map


![DC Metrorail Map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Wash-dc-metro-map.png/420px-Wash-dc-metro-map.png)

#### Questions:

1. What are some of the abstractions that you think are in this map? (You might want to use Google Maps or some other map resource to look at the DC region.)
1. Why do you think thees abstractions were made?

## What is not included in the model?

The map/model gives up absolute distance and to a lesser degree direction in order to simplify the representation of the _ordinal_ location of stop and needs and opportiunities for train transfers. 
	
#### Distance
	
Limiting ourselves to the redline with a starting point of Metro Central, the Metro map indicates that the Tenleytown-AU stop is roughly have way between Metro Central and the Rockville stop. However, from the Google Map you now see, it looks like the Rockville station is at least 4x farther.
	
#### Direction
	
Again on the red line, we see that Rockville is located significantly west of Glenmont. However, from the Google Map we see that Rockville is located north north-west of Glenmont.
	
### How does the abstraction help its purpose?
	
- Imagine the difficulty of differentiating all the metro stations in the inner-city region while still identicating the location of the suburban stations.
- You could not use this map to:
	- Estimate driving time between ...
	- ???

## Abstracting a Patient

When we generate and collect data on a patient, we are following the same steps the map maker is taking. We are ignoring some features about the patient and emphasizing (distorting?) others in order to make a map (abstraction) of that patient that helps us make decisions/take actions regarding that patient more efficiently---within our domain! 

## Focusing on our use case

The use-case for this short coure is centered on the the management of type II diabetes patients in a GP clinic. In this context, what do you think the essence of a person is in this context?

What are significant features that a person might feel are essential in their definition of their selfness that would likely not be included in the GP clinic abstraction of them
