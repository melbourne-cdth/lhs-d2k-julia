## Learning Objectives

This week we will be laying the conceptual framework that will form the infrastructure for understanding and working on the Learning Health System cycle. What is this cycle?

- Data to Knowledge
- Knowledge to Practice
- Practice to Data

Our cycle has three concepts:

1. Data
2. Knowledge
3. Practice

In this week we will focus on three concepts, but we are going to ignore _Practice_ and we are going to insert the concept of _Information_.

1. Data
1. Information
1. Knowledge

(DIK)

All elements of our DIK trio our commonplace in our lives. In fact, I think it would be hard to go a day outside of an off-the-grid vacation where we didn't read or hear about one of the three. Nonetheless, we hope to introduce you to a new way of thinking about Data, Information, and Knowledge, a new way that will help you be more insightful and productive in our current era of healthcare.

The key to success for Week 2 is to slow down and think twice about the topics we are discussing.
